# AutoTandemML
Automated Tandem Neural Networks for inverse design problems in science and engineering.

AutoTandemML utilizes active learning methods to efficiently generate a dataset to train a Tandem Neural Network for inverse design challenges. 

-----------------

The process consists of three main segments:

1. Generating a deteset with active learning 

2. Training the forward Deep Neural Network (x -> f(x)) 

3. Training the inverse Deep Neural Network (f(x) -> x)
